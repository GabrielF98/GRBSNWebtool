# The GRB-SN Webtool repository
This is the repository for the Gamma-ray burst Supernova association webtool. This tool was developed to ease the process of sharing information related to GRB-SN associations. Its purpose is to provide all of the required data for analysing a GRB-SN association in one place. The tool was created by Gabriel Finneran and Antonio Martin-Carrillo at University College Dublin. An in depth look at the tool can be found in this [paper]().

# Suggest changes
The repository contains the source code for the project as well as the data stored in the tool. Feel free to suggest updates by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/issues/new) or by forking the code and submitting a pull request.

# Alert us about missing data or upload your own
If you are aware of any missing data for any of the events in the catalogue you can log this as an issue [here](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/issues/new?assignees=GabrielF98&labels=add+data&template=alert-us-about-missing-data.md&title=Missing+data+for+%3Cevent+name+here%3E). 


Alternatively if you have data for any of these associations that you wish to upload you can do so by first [forking](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/fork) this repository and then suggesting changes via a pull request. You should add your files directly to the source file for that particular GRB-SN. These source files can be found [here](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/tree/master/Webtool/static/SourceData). You should also ensure that the citation file for the GRB-SN is updated correctly after data is added. The pull request should explain the type, format and source of the data as well as any other relevant information.
