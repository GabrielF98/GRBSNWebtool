# The GRB-SN Webtool repository
This is the repository for the Gamma-ray burst Supernova association webtool. This tool was developed to ease the process of sharing information related to GRB-SN associations. Its purpose is to provide all of the required data for analysing a GRB-SN association in one place. The tool was created by Gabriel Finneran and Antonio Martin-Carrillo at University College Dublin. An in depth look at the tool can be found in this [paper]().

# Alert us about missing/bad data
If you are aware of any missing observations or bad data or papers with parameters for any of the events in the catalogue you can log this as an issue [here](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/issues/new?assignees=GabrielF98&labels=add+data&template=alert-us-about-missing-data.md&title=Missing+data+for+%3Cevent+name+here%3E). 

# Upload your observations
If you have data from your own observations or publications for any of these associations that you wish to upload you can do so by:
1. [Forking](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/fork) this repository. 
2. Add your files directly to the source folder for that particular GRB-SN. These source files can be found at [Webtool/static/SourceData](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/tree/master/Webtool/static/SourceData). Any files uploaded should be of .txt format where possible.
3. Ensure that the citation file for the GRB-SN is updated correctly after data is added. 
4. Submit a pull request.

# Suggest improvements to the Webtool
This repository contains the source code for the project as well as the data stored in the tool. Feel free to suggest updates by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/issues/new) or by forking the code and submitting a pull request.
