# The GRB-SN Webtool
This is the repository for the Gamma-ray burst-Supernova associantion webtool for the sharing of information related to GRB-IcBL associations. Its purpose is to provide all of the required data for analysing a GRB-SN association in one place. The tool was created by Gabriel Finneran and Antonio Martin-Carrillo at University College Dublin. An in depth look at the tool can be found in this [paper]()
