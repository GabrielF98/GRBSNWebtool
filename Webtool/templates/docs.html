<h2><b>Sources of Data in this Webtool</b></h2>
	<p><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu" target = '_blank'> NASA ADS </a> This webtool used NASAâ€™s Astrophysics Data System to gather observational data and calculated quantities for each event in the catalogue. These papers provide much of the data in the webtool. They are referenced at the bottom of their respective pages and these references are also provided when downloading any of the data.</p> <br> 
	<p><a href="https://sne.space" target = '_blank'> The Open Supernova Catalogue </a> The Open Supernova Catalogue's API feature was used to gather the bulk of the graphical data for this tool, in particular the optical photometry and spectra. A detailed description of this tool can be found in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...835...64G/abstract" target = '_blank'>Guillochon et al. 2017</a></p> <br>
	<p><a href="https://www.swift.ac.uk" target = '_blank'> Swift Telescope UK Site </a> Provided the XRT Xray plot data as well as the BAT RA and Dec positions.</p> <br>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.wis-tns.org" target='_blank'> Transient Name Server (TNS)</a> was used to create the plot on the homepage showing the number of events per year.</p>
