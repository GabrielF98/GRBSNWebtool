time column: The Rspecial filter is about 10% broader than the standard RC. Filters Js and Ks are narrower with respect to the canonical J and K bands, respectively: Js has a width of 0.16 μm (instead of 0.29 μm), and Ks has a width of 0.29 μm centered at 2.16 μm (instead of 0.35 μm centered at 2.20 μm). However, since both narrowband filters have a higher transmission than the canonical filters, the net effect is that J-Js ≲ 0.05 (K-Ks ≲ 0.02) when comparing the ISAAC Js vs. the SOFI J filter. The grisms 150I, 300I, and 600B are described in the text.

mag_col: Not corrected for Galactic foreground extinction.

nan_values: Image quality affected by guiding problems. Variable seeing due to varying cirrus.

Footnotes from table:

time column: Mean time since GRB trigger on 21.7828 November 2001 UT.

wavelength column: The effective wavelength of the filter is based on the observed SFD of the transient at the given epoch. 

flux_density column: The flux is given at this effective wavelength in a 0&farcs;5 radius. The observed count rate, corrected for CTE effects, was converted to flux using the IRAF/SYNPHOT package. An input spectrum with fν = constant was first assumed. Then approximate spectral indices between each filter were computed and then used to recompute the flux and the effective wavelength of the filters. This bootstrapping converged after a few iterations. The HST photometry contains an unknown but small contribution from the host galaxy at the OT location. We attempted to estimate the contamination of the host at the transient position by measuring the host flux in several apertures at approximate isophotal levels to the OT position. We estimate the contribution of the host galaxy to be fν(F450W) = 0.098 ± 0.039 μJy, fν(F555W) = 0.087 ± 0.027 μJy, fν(F702W) = 0.127 ± 0.026 μJy, fν(F814W) = 0.209 ± 0.059 μJy, and fν(F850LP) = 0.444 ± 0.103 μJy. To correct these numbers to "infinite aperture," multiply the fluxes by 1.096 (Holtzman et al. 1995). These fluxes have not been corrected for Galactic or host extinction. 

magnitude column: Tabulated brightnesses in the Vega magnitude system (BVega = 0.02 mag, VVega = 0.03 mag, RVega = 0.039 mag, and IVega = 0.035 mag; Holtzman et al. 1995). Subtract 0.1 mag from these values to get the infinite aperture brightness. These magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic or host extinction.

Note.—Observations at the du Pont (dP) 2.5 m were made by K. Koviak; observations at the AAT were made by S. D. Ryder (Nov 22) and K. Gunn (Nov 28); and observations at the Baade telescope were made by M. Phillips. The following reference stars were used. For Ks observations on the AAT, we observed UKIRT Faint Standards FS 7, 11, and 13 (Hawarden et al. 2001) on 2001 November 28. SJ 9113 (Persson et al. 1998) was observed at the du Pont telescope on 2001 November 23. We assumed an atmospheric extinction coefficient of 0.09 mag per air mass in K for the du Pont observations and that the color terms were negligible. We used the reference stars calibrated by Phillips et al. (2001) to calibrate our J-band observations. The AAT measurement of November 28 is contaminated by both the host and the nearby star.
