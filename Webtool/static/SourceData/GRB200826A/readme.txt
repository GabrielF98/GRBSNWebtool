Notes: Radio data. Radio observations of GRB 200826A.

There is a typo in the original data. The units should be in microJy, not in erg/cm2/s. This has been corrected.

Notes: Table of 5GHz observations from eMERLIN. ‘T’ is the time in the middle of each observation and ‘T0’ is 04:29:52 UT on 2020 August 26 (Fermi GBM Team 2020). In order to reach lower noise levels, we concatenated some of data sets. The central time of each concatenated data set is shown in the column labelled Tc. The errorbars quoted with the observation times reflect the duration of each observation. Any flux density value prefixed by ‘<’ is a 3σ upper limit.

Concatenated data was retained; the original data can be found in the OriginalFormats folder.

Data-type: Xray
---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: The XRT data was reduced by the the online reduction pipeline.As the hardness ratio remains constant within error bars, we assume a single absorbed power law spectrum, with a Galactic neutral hydrogen column151 of to 6.02 × 1020cm−2. Data in counts.

Notes: Swift-XRT flux densities at 10 keV and photon indices in the range 0.3–10 keV. ‘T’ is the time in the middle of each observation and ‘T0’ is 04:29:52 UT on 2020 August 26 (Fermi GBM Team 2020). ΔT (d) reflects the duration of each observation (Evans et al. 2007).
