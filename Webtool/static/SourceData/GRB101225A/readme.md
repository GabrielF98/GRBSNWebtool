### GRB101225A_Optical_1.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...781...13L/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, IR, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes: Photometric observations of GRB 101225A obtained at the WHT and Gemini-N. The magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction; to do so would require corrections based on Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) of A_B = 0.37, A_g = 0.33, A_r = 0.23, A_i = 0.17, and A_z = 0.13.

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Natur.480...72T/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical, UV

**Notes:**

Notes: Log of UVOIR observations. Values are not corrected for Galactic extinction.
