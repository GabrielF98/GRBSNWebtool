      Notes: A log of the HST observations of each of GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A, showing instrument and filters used for each observation, along with the time since burst trigger and, where appropriate, the measured magnitude of the optical/IR counterpart.

      Notes: Photometric observations of GRB 101225A obtained at the WHT and Gemini-N. The magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction; to do so would require corrections based on Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) of A_B = 0.37, A_g = 0.33, A_r = 0.23, A_i = 0.17, and A_z = 0.13.
