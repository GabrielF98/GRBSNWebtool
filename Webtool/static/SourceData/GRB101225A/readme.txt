---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Photometric observations of GRB 101225A obtained at the WHT and Gemini-N. The magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction; to do so would require corrections based on Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) of A_B = 0.37, A_g = 0.33, A_r = 0.23, A_i = 0.17, and A_z = 0.13.
