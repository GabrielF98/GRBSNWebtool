Abstract:

Gamma-ray burst (GRB) 190829A (z=0.0785) was detected by Fermi and

Swift and also at very high energy (VHE) by the High-Energy

Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. The prompt emission

displayed two emission episodes separated by a quiescent gap of ~40s.

We present the 10.4m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) observations of

the afterglow of GRB 190829A and its underlying supernova. We also

compare GRB190829A to GRB180728A, a GRB with similar behaviour, and

discuss the implications on underlying physical mechanisms producing

these two GRBs.



We present multi-band photometric data along with spectroscopic

follow-up observations taken with the 10.4m GTC telescope. Together

with the data from the prompt emission, the 10.4m GTC data are used

to understand the emission mechanisms and possible progenitor.



A detailed analysis of the multi-band observations of the afterglow

requires the cooling frequency to pass between the optical and X-ray

bands at early epochs. The afterglow then transitions to the

underlying supernova (SN) 2019oyw, which dominates later on.



Although the prompt emission temporal properties of GRB 190829A and

GRB 180728A are similar, the two pulses are different in the spectral

domain. We find that SN 2019oyw associated with GRB 190829A is powered

by Ni decay and is a Type Ic-BL SN. The spectroscopic and photometric

properties of this SN are consistent with those observed for SN

1998bw, but evolved earlier.



Description:

On 29 August 2019 at T0=19:55:53 UT, Fermi triggered on GRB190829A,

which at T0+51s was also triggered by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)

onboard Swift. We observed this event with Gran Telescopio CANARIAS

(GTC) equipped with OSIRIS at four different epochs (~0.32d, 1.29d,

2.23d and 4.09d post-burst in rest-frame) and determine its redshift

z=0.0785. Here we supply those reduced spectroscopy of GRB 190829A

taken from GTC in ASCII format (before correction for redshift,

extinction, and also not been scaled with the photometric fluxes).

Those spectra already been mentioned in Table 2 and plotted in Figure

3 and Figure 4 after analysis process in the paper.
