      Notes:
      - AB system magnitudes in the HST filters given in the fifth column. Photometry was done on residual images (see § 3). We have assumed the source flux to be negligible in the final (template) epoch for GRB 040924. For GRB 041006, we estimated the source flux in the template epoch using PSF photometry and corrected the residual photometry accordingly. All represent observed magnitudes, not corrected for foreground extinction.
      - Galactic extinction from Schlegel et al. (1998).
      - Magnitudes from the sixth column, converted to the Vega system and corrected for foreground extinction using Aλ given in the seventh column.

      KAIT measurements were unfiltered but transformed to R (Li et al. 2003a, 2003b).

      Notes: 
      SSO 40 Inch and 2.3 m Observations of GRB 041006.
      Magnitude is corrected for Galactic extinction according to Schlegel et al. (1998). B- and V-band photometry is relative to the field calibration by Henden (2004) while the H-band photometry is relative to 2MASS.
