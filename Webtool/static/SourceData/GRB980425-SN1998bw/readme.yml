      Notes: JD =Mean Julian Date-2450000. The days were converted to MJD. References for photometry are (1)Galama et al.1998 (2)this work; (3) Sollerman et al.2002.Using the computed reddening and K-corrections unreddened and transformed to the rest frame, the photometry of SN 1998bw.

      As the Sollerman data is presented in Optical_6.txt, and the Galama data is present in the data from OpenSN catalogues we removed these datapoints from this file.

      Notes:  Ground-based B, V, R, and I photometry of SN 1998bw .A PSF was constructed from stars in the field using DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987). It was used to add ten artificial stars with the same flux as the supernova to user-specified locations on the original frame. The magnitudes of these stars were then retrieved using the same technique as for the supernova. This method was used to assess the accuracy of our measurements, and the standard deviations in the differences in the retrieved magnitudes of the artificial stars were adopted as the errors on the supernova magnitudes.

       Notes:	Near-IR photometry of SN 1998bw was obtained at three epochs with SofI at the ESO-NTT (see Table 2) through the J, H, and K passbands (Bessell & Brett 1988). In order to allow for a proper sky subtraction, the target was observed using the jittering technique. The reductions were performed in a standard way within IRAF, and the fluxes were estimated via plain aperture photometry, since at those early epochs the contribution from the host galaxy was negligible. The photometric errors were estimated including the nightly zero-point variations, the aperture correction, and the photon shot noise. The SN was observed at two positions along the slit, and the telescope was nodded between these two positions once every few minutes.

      Notes: Flux in units of counts per second. The first pointing was broken into two parts. Source 1 was the only one included as this was found to be 1999bw.Uncertainties are at 1-σ; upper limits are at 3-σ.

      This file was modified for the purposes of the GRBSN tool. We retatined only the S1 source of the BeppoSAX data, as later observations revealed that this is the source which corresponds to the AG. Additionally we have converted the count rates to fluxes based on a sample conversion given in the publication. The conversion factor is approximately 6.5e-11 erg/s/cm2/ct. This is in the range 2-10keV, where the counts were given in 1.6-10keV.

      Notes: For each image, we compared the instrumental magnitude of the supernova to the average instrumental magni- tude of the Ðve standard stars. This di†erence was then applied to the average of the standard starsÏ actual magni- tudes taken from the Galama et al. Finding Chart to deter- mine the actual magnitude of SN 1998bw.The overall light curve shape is similar to those of Type Ia, Ib, Ic, and IIL supernovae.

      Notes: GRB 980425/SN 1998bw was observed with the LBA using an array comprising the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA; phased array of five 22 m dishes), Ceduna, Hobart and Parkes, on 2015 November 16 (Program ID V541A). The observing setup used 2×16 MHz subbands in dual polariza- tion, Nyquist sampled with 2 bits (256 Mbps data rate), and centered on a sky frequency of 1.65 GHz.3σ limit on the spectral luminosity assuming redshifts listed in Table 1.

      Notes: The OpenSN Catalogue did not return any uncertainties for the early time data. An uncertainty of 0.05 on VBRI magnitudes and an uncertainty of 0.1 on U magnitudes was added manually from Galama et al. (1998).
