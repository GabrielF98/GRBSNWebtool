Notes:The uncertainties are the result of combining in quadrature the uncertainties of photometry, reddening and K-corrections.Units are 1e40 erg/cm^2^/s. Uncertainty does not include the ~7% uncertainty in the distance.

Not including this in the Master files, as it is an amalgam of multiple datasets, some of which are already collected.
