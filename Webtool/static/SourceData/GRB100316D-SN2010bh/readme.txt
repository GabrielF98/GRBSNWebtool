UBVRI Observed Magnitudes of SN 2010bh
Notes.
a Phases from Swift/BAT trigger (2010 March 16.53; Stamatikos et al. 2010) in the host-galaxy rest frame. No corrections have been applied to the reported magnitudes, with exception of the (*) S-correction for the PROMPT ones.
b Upper limit.
Calibration was performed using Landolt stars for U and Stetson stars for BVRI. This implys that both are Vega magnitudes.

GROND photometry of XRF 100316D/SN 2010bh after image subtraction.
Notes. The template image for subtraction was taken 234 days after burst. The time reference is t0 = 55   271.53113 MJD, the date of the GRB trigger. All magnitudes are in the AB system and corrected for neither Galactic nor host-galaxy extinction. Upper limits are all at the 3σ confidence level. Errors include the systematics of the photometric calibration.
