---------------------------------------------------------

Notes: Observations of GRB 020410, showing the time of each observation and the observed magnitude (or limiting magnitude). Also shown in the case of the STIS images are the measured magnitudes of the OT before and after the host has been subtracted and the relevant K-corrections to correct from Bessel B and V filters to that of STIS. These are based on the observed spectrum of SN 1998bw, which is spectroscopically similar to that of both SNe 1997ef and 2002ap and indeed the recent SN 2003dh (GRB 030329). The uncertainty quoted is based simply on the uncertainty in the measured number of counts in the aperture and does not reflect the potential uncertainty in the underlying spectrum. Numbers in parentheses indicate the host-subtracted counts. Magnitudes have not been extinction-corrected; the correction is ∼0.37 mag to F606W and 0.31 mag to F814W.
