Observation log for GRB 120422A / SN 2012bz.

Δt refers to the beginning of the observations and corresponds to the delay since the burst event. UBVRI magnitudes are in the Vega system,

g′r′i′z′ magnitudes are in the AB system, and they have not been corrected for Galactic absorption. Errors are given at the 1σ confidence level.

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...566A.102S/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Magnitudes are corrected for Galactic extinction (E(B − V) = 0.03 mag). Column “Epoch” shows the logarithmic mean-time after the GRB in the observer frame.

We only display the total observing time of the Swift/UVOT and P60 data (see Sect. 2.2 for details).

As described in Sect. 2.3, photometry was tied to the SDSS DR8 standard (g′r′i′z′) and to the 2MASS standard (JHKs).

For those filters not covered by our primary calibration systems (RICiY), we used the instrument-specific band passes to transform magnitudes into the respective filter system.\



The observation on MJD 56047.890 using the NOT/ALFOSC telescope is a stack of images with different exposure times. The shown time is the sum of the single images.
