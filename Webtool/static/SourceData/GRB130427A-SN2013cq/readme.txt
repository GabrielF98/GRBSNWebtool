Notes: Peak Flux Densities and Absolute Magnitudes for SN 2013cq and SN 1998bw shifted to z = 0.34. Removed data for 1998bw. The peak flux desnity and magnitudes by averaging the residuals from days 18 to 26 (post GRB trigger). 

GRB-SN have provided the peak times from the paper as the times at which the peak absolute mags were calculated. No estimate of peak time was available for the Infrared bands.

Notes: Log of HST observations of GRB 130427A. Optical observations were obtained with ACS, while UV and IR imaging was taken with WFC3 in the UVIS and IR channels respectively. The magnitudes shown are for a point source at the GRB location and not for the overall host galaxy + afterglow combination. The magnitudes are corrected for a foreground extinction of A_F336W = 0.090 mag, A_F606W = 0.050 mag, and A_F160W = 0.010 mag. Errors in the magnitudes are only statistical.

Notes: Exposure mid-time, measured from the Fermi-GBM trigger (UT 07:47:06.42). bObserved value, not corrected for Galactic extinction and including host-galaxy flux. cCorrected for Galactic extinction (EB − V = 0.02 mag) and host-galaxy contribution. Except for the P60 observations, uncertainties do not include the uncertainty resulting from subtraction of the host flux; this is negligible over most of the afterglow evolution but contributes a large, systematic uncertainty during the SN phase.

Notes: Flux of GRB 130427A afterglow in the 0.3–10 keV band, as measured by XMM–Newton and Chandra observations presented in this work. Note: we have added a 10 per cent systematics error these quantities before building the composite light curve shown in Fig. 1 and fitting it. Note: the third and the last line show the mid-time for the XMM–Newton observations taken in 2013 November and 2015 December.Flux was 10^-15 and in cgs units and this cgs units were taken to be erg/s/cm2/s-1. Time was origionally in units of Ms.

Notes: Integration time is the integration mid time that is measured from the Fermi-GBM trigger (UT 07:47:06.42). The frequenct is the central frequency. Some BLA, CARMA and GMRT are from Laskar et al. (2013).

Notes: WSRT observations of GRB 130427A, with ΔT the mid-point of each observation in days after the Fermi/GBM trigger time. The long 4.8 GHz observations on April 28/29 and 29/30 have been divided up into 1-h time intervals and the results are given at the bottom of the table.
