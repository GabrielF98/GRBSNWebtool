      Notes: VLA and WSRT Observations of the GRB 030329 Radio Afterglow at 5 GHz

      Notes: The data were taken under VLA project codes AF414^1, AK583^2, AS864^3, and TYP100^4, and WSRT sequence numbers 10502389^5, 10506025^6, and 10602115^7. WSRT data appearing in this table correspond to data from van der Horst et al. (2005, 2008) that were re-analyzed to ensure uniformity of analysis across all data points.

      The measurement uncertainties are given at $1 \sigma$ level. 
      In the case of the observations on: 2004-Jan-25.833-26.333/2004-May-2.566-3.065/2004-Nov-20.014-20.486/2005-Mar-26.667-27.167 - meaningful formal flux measurement at the GRB position cannot be determined because of confusion by a very nearby, bright source. 
      In the case of the observations on: 2004-Jan-29.995-30.134 - Formal flux measurement at the GRB position gives $1\pm 216$ $\mu$Jy. 
      In the case of the observations on: 2005-May-15.531-15.883 - Formal flux measurement at the GRB position gives  $-69\pm 103$ $\mu$Jy.

Net on-source integration time is typically about half of this.(5) Time since the burst (2003 March 29.48 UT). Middle of the observing run is taken here.(6) Observing frequency. An average of USB and LSB frequencies.``141GHz'' means an average of 146.969 \pm 0.5 GHz and 134.969 \pm 0.5 GHz bands, and``93GHz'' means an average of 98.824 \pm 0.5 GHz and 86.824 \pm 0.5 GHz bands, respectively.(7) Flux density.(8) Noise level (1 \sigma).(9) System noise temperature in DSB. ``Bad'' means that the dataset was useless due to bad weather.(10) Atmospheric phase stability.``Bad'' means a large fraction of the visibility data should be discarded due to large phase noise.}

      Columns are (1) epoch of observation, (2) time in days from burst, (3) flux density at 1.43 GHz, (4) flux density at 4.86 GHz, (5) flux density at 8.46 GHz, (6) flux density at 15 GHz, and (7) flux density at 22.5 GHz. To maximize sensitivity, the full VLA bandwidth (100 MHz) was recorded in each of two hands of circular polarization. The amplitude scale was calibrated with observations of J1331+303 (3C 286), while phase calibration was achieved with frequent observations of J1051+2119 at all frequencies except for 1.43 GHz, where J1016+2037 was used instead.

      NOTE.—These photometric observations have been grouped into 13 epochs. The total duration of the epoch—from the time of the beginning of the first exposure until the ending time of the last exposure—is shown as δt. 
      a UT start time of the exposure. All observations were conducted in the year 2003.
      b Time since the GRB trigger.
      c Observed magnitude in the Landolt+Persson filter system, uncorrected for Galactic and host reddening. The errors given are statistical only. The systematic uncertainty in the zero-point calibrations, to be added in quadrature with the statistical errors, are B = 0.03 mag, V = 0.04 mag, I = 0.06 mag, J = 0.05 mag, and H = 0.05 mag.
      d Equivalent flux measurement at the effective wavelength of the respective filter [λeff(B) = 4513.5 Å, (V) = 5556.3 Å, (I) = 7935.0 Å, (J) = 12440 Å, (H) = 16528 Å]. As described in the text, the values for λeff and zero points were determined self-consistently for the observed input spectrum. No correction due to reddening from dust has been applied. The errors reflect both the statistical and systematic magnitude zero-point uncertainty in the flux measurement. No uncertainty in the filter flux zero point has been included.
