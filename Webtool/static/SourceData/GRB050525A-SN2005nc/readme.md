### GRB050525A-SN2005nc_Optical_NIR.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427..288R/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, NIR, Optical

**Notes:**

Log of optical and NIR observations. 
Time = t − t0 where t0 = 25-05-25.002 d.
NaN value in the mag column in the final observation is because the magnitude is the result of the combination of the J-band data taken on 2011 July 18 and 19.

### GRB050525A-SN2005nc_Optical.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...439L..35K/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Optical

**Notes:**

Log of the measurements. The first column is the T date from GRB (in minutes) as defined by Eq. (1). The second is the CR magnitude (this is a converted clear filter magnitude, converted to R band.) and the third is the error.
Magnitude errors are 2 sigma.
