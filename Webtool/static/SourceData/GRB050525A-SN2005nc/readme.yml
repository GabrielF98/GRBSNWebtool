      The quoted limits are 3σ upper limits. 
      Beam is a synthesized beam.
      T = t − t0 where t0 = 25-05-25.002 d.

      Log of optical and NIR observations. 
      Time = t − t0 where t0 = 25-05-25.002 d.
      NaN value in the mag column in the final observation is because the magnitude is the result of the combination of the J-band data taken on 2011 July 18 and 19.

      Log of the measurements. The first column is the T date from GRB (in minutes) as defined by Eq. (1). The second is the CR magnitude (this is a converted clear filter magnitude, converted to R band.) and the third is the error.
      Magnitude errors are 2 sigma.
