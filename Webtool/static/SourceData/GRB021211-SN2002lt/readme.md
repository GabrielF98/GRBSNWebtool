### GRB021211-SN2002lt_Optical.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...651..994N/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Observations on 2002-Dec-11.4732 & 2002-Dec-11.4751 are flux weighted using an iterated power-law index of α = -1.37 (§ 2.1).



The magnitude errors are 3 sigma.
