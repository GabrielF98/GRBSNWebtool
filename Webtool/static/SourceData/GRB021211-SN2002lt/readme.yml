      Observations on 2002-Dec-11.4732 & 2002-Dec-11.4751 are flux weighted using an iterated power-law index of α = -1.37 (§ 2.1).

      The magnitude errors are 3 sigma.

      2003-Jan-9.7 this observation is the average of two measurements obtained on Jan. 9.3 and 10.2.
      Magnitudes are referred to the complex afterglow + host. Errors are 1-$\sigma$.

      time column: Hours since the burst trigger on 2002 December 11, 11:18:34.03 UT. The first four are the flux-weighted mean exposure time using a power-law decline of index -1.6.
      mag column: Transformed from unfiltered observations.
      row1 obs: Superposed on a longer supernova follow-up observation.
      row4-row14, row18-row22:  Measured on 3 × 20 s grid images.
