Observations on 2002-Dec-11.4732 & 2002-Dec-11.4751 are flux weighted using an iterated power-law index of α = -1.37 (§ 2.1).

The magnitude errors are 3 sigma.

mag column: Transformed from unfiltered observations.
row1 obs: Superposed on a longer supernova follow-up observation.
row4-row14, row18-row22:  Measured on 3 × 20 s grid images.
