---------------------------------------------------------
The time tmid is the time from the BAT trigger to the middle of the observation. The exposure time is denoted by Δt. Upper limits are 3 σ upper limits. Errors are 1 σ statistical errors and do not include the systematic errors in the photometric zero points. 
a This data point consists of co-added data. See original data for this info.

Data-type: Early, NIR, Optical
---------------------------------------------------------
- Days since explosion have been calculated for the midpoint of each exposure.
- Magnitudes have not been corrected for extinction. Limits are given as 3 σ.
- The observation on 2005-Apr-16.4772, 2005-Apr-17.4006 is in the AB system.

Data-type: Late, Optical
---------------------------------------------------------
- AB system magnitudes in the HST filters given in the fourth column. Photometry was done on residual images (see § 2.2). We have assumed the source flux to be negligible in the final (template) epoch. Magnitudes have not been corrected for extinction.
- We convert the F775W magnitudes in the fifth column to Johnson I band (Vega system) as described in § 2.2. Magnitudes have not been corrected for extinction.
