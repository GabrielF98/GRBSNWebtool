### GRB060904B_Optical.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...483..847K/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Caption from table: Log of the optical measurements of GRB 060904B from TAROT and GCN Circulars. T are seconds since $t_{\rm trig}$. C magnitudes of TAROT images were translated to the R photometric band by an appropriate offset. Errors $\Delta $mag are 2$\sigma $ for TAROT data.



The GCN notice name was replaced with the name of the instrument that took the data.
