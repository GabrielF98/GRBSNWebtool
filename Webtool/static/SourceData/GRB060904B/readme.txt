Caption from table: Log of the optical measurements of GRB 060904B from TAROT and GCN Circulars. T are seconds since  $t_{\rm trig}$. C magnitudes of TAROT images were translated to the R photometric band by an appropriate offset. Errors $\Delta $mag are 2$\sigma $ for TAROT data.

The GCN notice name was replaced with the name of the instrument that took the data.
