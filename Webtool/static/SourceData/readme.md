# Data Standardisation

We have undertaken to convert all data gathered for the GRBSN webtool into a common format. 
The format is described in this document for the benefit of the end users.

## Categories available in the webtool
It is important to note that these headings will not appear in all files. They only appear if
the original data fits into one of these categories. The list is organised by category, then column, 
then the associated unit columns and units.

**Dates**
  * `date` The date of observation. 
  * `date_unit` The unit of the date of observation:
    * ``yyyy-month-deciday`` The year, month and decimal day.
    * ``MJD`` Modified Julian Day.

**Times**


**Bands**

**Optical** 

**X-ray**

**Radio**

**Spectra**

**Instruments**
