Data-type: Optical, Late
---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: This photometry is not corrected for extinction, but the small-aperture HST photometry has been aperture- and CTE-corrected. Note that these fluxes include both transient light and host light within the apertures, whereas in creating Figure 2 the host contribution was modeled and removed, as described in the text. Independent reduction of some of these data already reported in Tanvir et al. (2008b) and Bloom et al. (2009). Provisional photometry already reported in Tanvir et al. (2008a) and Racusin et al. (2008). Provisional photometry already reported in Levan et al. (2008). The observations for 106.4 and
108.3 days are there twice due to to differnt fluxes being obtained at different magnitudes.
