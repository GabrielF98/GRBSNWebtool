The text files listed below were downloaded from papers on [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu) and converted to the GRBSN [format](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/tree/master/Webtool/static/SourceData). The 'Master.txt' file(s) are a combination of these text files and contain all of the downloaded data for a paticular wavelength range.

### GRB080319B_Optical_5.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...725..625T/abstract

**Data-type:** Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes: This photometry is not corrected for extinction, but the small-aperture HST photometry has been aperture- and CTE-corrected. Note that these fluxes include both transient light and host light within the apertures, whereas in creating Figure 2 the host contribution was modeled and removed, as described in the text. Independent reduction of some of these data already reported in Tanvir et al. (2008b) and Bloom et al. (2009). Provisional photometry already reported in Tanvir et al. (2008a) and Racusin et al. (2008). Provisional photometry already reported in Levan et al. (2008). The observations for 106.4 and
108.3 days are there twice due to to differnt fluxes being obtained at different magnitudes.

**Notes:**

Notes: UT at midpoint of exposure.. Time from midpoint of exposure to Swift/BAT trigger.Upper limits are reported as 2sigma rms per beam area.

### GRB080319B_Radio_2.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...504...45P/abstract

**Data-type:** Radio

**Notes:**

Notes: Observations of GRB  080319B afterglow at millimeter frequencies were performed with the Plateau de Bure (PdB) Interferometer (Guilloteau et al. 1992) in a six-antenna extended configuration on the dates. The afterglow was detected in the first round of observations starting 0.5 days after the burst and upper limits were established at two later epochs. Radio observations were also performed using RATAN-600 at 4.8 GHz between 9 and 19 days after the burst and the afterglow was not detected. The afterglow was also monitored using the radio telescope RT-22/CrAO at 2.0 and 8.0 GHz on 25th May 2008. The upper limits (3$\sigma$) inferred from RATAN-600 and RT-22/CrAO observations.

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...691..723B/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, NIR

**Notes:**

Notes:  Because of the very large number of exposures acquired, only a few representative points are given. The full table of photometry containing all 406 points is available online. Includes only nonsaturated exposures; photometry from the saturated epochs is given in Tables 2 and 3. aExposure midtime, measured from the Swift trigger (UTC 06:12:49). 
Zero-point determinations were made in comparison to the 2MASS catalog. Vega was the magnitude system.
