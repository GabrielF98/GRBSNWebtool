      Optical and Near-IR Observations of GRB 161219B
      References removed from the data set
      Band CR changed to R as stated in paper
      Instrument column includes name of observatory
      An uncertainty of 0.2 AB mag is assumed where not provided. The data have not been corrected for Galactic extinction.

      GRB 161219B: Log of VLA Observations
      the flux density is a 3Ïƒ upper limit, and the uncertainty refers to the mean map noise. We include the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope detection reported by Nayana & Chandra (2016).

      GRB 161219B/SN 2016jca: Photometry.
      PS1 data omitted due to lack of date/ time information
      UVOT photometry and those in filters griz are in the AB system, while JHK are Vega. All photometry is of the AG+SN+host, and are uncorrected for extinction.t0 = 2457742.284in Julian date.
