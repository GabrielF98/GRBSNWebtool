**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

GRB 161219B/SN 2016jca: Photometry.

PS1 data omitted due to lack of date/ time information

UVOT photometry and those in filters griz are in the AB system, while JHK are Vega. All photometry is of the AG+SN+host, and are uncorrected for extinction.t0 = 2457742.284in Julian date.
