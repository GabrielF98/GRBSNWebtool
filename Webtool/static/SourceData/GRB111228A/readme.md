The text files listed below were downloaded from papers on [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu) and converted to the GRBSN [format](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/tree/master/Webtool/static/SourceData). The 'Master.txt' file(s) are a combination of these text files and contain all of the downloaded data for a paticular wavelength range.

### GRB111228A_Optical_1.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A.138K/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes: t-t0 is the time in units of days after the burst (t0=28 December 2011, 15:44:43 UT; Ukwatta et al. 2011). The data are not corrected for Galactic extinction.

### GRB111228A_NIR_Optical.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...817..152X/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, NIR, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes: The reference time T_0 is Swift BAT burst trigger time. "T - T0" is the middle time in hours for each data point. "Exposure" is the exposure time for each data in seconds. All data are not corrected for the Galactic extinction (which is ${E}_{B-V}=0.03$, Schlegel et al. 1998). B-band data is calibrated by USNO B1.0 B2 mag with 2 stars. Other data are calibrated by SDSS reference stars. The magnitudes in SDSS filters are in AB magnitude system, and others are in the Vega magnitude system.

### GRB111228A_UV_Optical.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A.138K/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Optical, UV

**Notes:**

Notes: There was a mistake in the data where a magnitude was given as 8.46 and this was changed to 18.46. Midtimes are derived logarithmically, t10([log(t1−t0)+log(t2−t0)]/2), hereby t1.2 are the start and stop times, t0 is the Swift trigger time. Upper limits marked with a represent stacks of all observations in each specific filter that yielded only upper limits, to obtain deeper limits on the host galaxy.

### GRB111228A_Optical_2.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A.138K/abstract

**Data-type:** Late, NIR, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes: Given magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction. The time refers to how many days after the corresponding burst the data were taken.
