Notes: Data have not been corrected for Galactic foreground extinction, and are given in Vega magnitudes. Late exposure times of UVOT data actually show the interval between the beginning and the end of observations.

Data-type: Early,Optical, Late
---------------------------------------------------------
The data in file 'table3.dat' are the apparent magnitudes of the
afterglow+supernova+host (combined), which are not corrected for
foreground or rest-frame extinction. Note that the ROTSE magnitudes
are unfiltered calibrated to sdss_r_.
Notes: The griz magnitudes of the host galaxy were measured, and these magnitudes were converted into monochromatic fluxes using the flux zeropoints from Fukugita et al. (1995) and subtracted from the earlier observations obtained with the LT, FTN and IAC80. The apparent magnitudes (not corrected for foreground or host extinction) of the GRB+SN+host are presented in Table 3. Data obtaiend from Vizier.
Note (1): Apparent magnitudes of the afterglow+supernova+host (combined),
     which are not corrected for foreground or rest-frame extinction.
Note (2): ROTSE magnitudes are unfiltered calibrated to sdss_r_.

Notes: t-t0 is the time in units of days after the burst (t0=31 August 2013, 13:04:16 UT; Hagen et al. 2013). The data are not corrected for Galactic extinction.
