Source: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.455.1027D/abstract
Data-type: Early,Optical, UV
---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Data have not been corrected for Galactic foreground extinction, and are given in Vega magnitudes. Late exposure times of UVOT data actually show the interval between the beginning and the end of observations.

Data-type: Early,Optical, Late
---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: The griz magnitudes of the host galaxy were measured, and these magnitudes were converted into monochromatic fluxes using the flux zeropoints from Fukugita et al. (1995) and subtracted from the earlier observations obtained with the LT, FTN and IAC80. The apparent magnitudes (not corrected for foreground or host extinction) of the GRB+SN+host are presented in Table 3. Data obtaiend from Vizier.

Data-type: Early,Optical, Late,NIR
---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: t-t0 is the time in units of days after the burst (t0=31 August 2013, 13:04:16 UT; Hagen et al. 2013). The data are not corrected for Galactic extinction.

Data-type: IR, NIR, Optical, Late
---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Given magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction. The time refers to how many days after the corresponding burst the data were taken. Errors on the flux are the 90 percent confidence interval. Spectral index cstat and dof columns removed.
