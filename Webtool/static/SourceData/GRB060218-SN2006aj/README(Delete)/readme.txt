The flux density column was called flux in the original paper. However, as it was measured in mJy it is obviously a flux density. 

Log of the Radio Observations for GRB 060218.
The flux calibration has been performed using the source 3C 286 as standard. The observations on February 21 and February 28 were alternated between 1.4 and 4.9 GHz, and 2.3 and 4.9 GHz, respectively, observing in 40 minute blocks at each frequency.
