      Notes: Magnitudes are in the AB system, without correction for galactic extinction, whereas the flux densities have been corrected for it.

      Notes: The GRB was detected at all epochs (>3sigma, except the 4.9 GHz session on 2011 September 15 and the 7.9 GHz session on 2012 August 21 when the detections were <3sigma). delta T is the number of the days since prompt emission. rms is taken to be the error on the flux.
