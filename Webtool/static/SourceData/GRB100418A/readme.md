The text files listed below were downloaded from papers on [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu) and converted to the GRBSN [format](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/tree/master/Webtool/static/SourceData). The 'Master.txt' file(s) are a combination of these text files and contain all of the downloaded data for a paticular wavelength range.

### GRB100418A_NIR_Optical_1.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...620A.190D/abstract

**Data-type:** Late, Early. Optical, NIR

**Notes:**

Notes: Magnitudes are in the AB system, without correction for galactic extinction, whereas the flux densities have been corrected for it.

### GRB100418A_Radio_1.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...620A.190D/abstract

**Data-type:** Late, Radio, Early

**Notes:**

Notes:Blended with the nearby source NVSS J170527.66 +112706.9

### GRB100418A_Radio_2.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...779..105M/abstract

**Data-type:** Late, Radio, Early

**Notes:**

Notes: The GRB was detected at all epochs (>3sigma, except the 4.9 GHz session on 2011 September 15 and the 7.9 GHz session on 2012 August 21 when the detections were <3sigma). delta T is the number of the days since prompt emission. rms is taken to be the error on the flux.

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...727..132M/abstract

**Data-type:** Late,Optical, Early, UV

**Notes:**

Notes: Mean time since the BAT trigger in units of ks; (2) Rate in counts s^-1;x
