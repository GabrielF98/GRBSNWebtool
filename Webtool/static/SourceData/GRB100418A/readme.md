### GRB100418A_NIR_Optical_1.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...620A.190D/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, NIR, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes: Magnitudes are in the AB system, without correction for galactic extinction, whereas the flux densities have been corrected for it.

### GRB100418A_Radio_2.txt

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...779..105M/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Radio

**Notes:**

Notes: The GRB was detected at all epochs (>3sigma, except the 4.9 GHz session on 2011 September 15 and the 7.9 GHz session on 2012 August 21 when the detections were <3sigma). delta T is the number of the days since prompt emission. rms is taken to be the error on the flux.
