      Notes: Upper limits are 3 σ.

      A log of all the photometry on GRB 970228, obtained in the B, V, RC, and IC passbands (corresponding to the Johnson B and Cousins VRI systems); some photometry derived from unfiltered passbands and translated to B or RC; the HST WFPC2 and STIS filters; and the near-infrared J, H, K, and K&arcmin; passbands. In order to minimize calibration differences as a result of use of different filters/instruments and differences in analysis, we consistently determined the magnitude of the optical transient (OT) relative to our calibration.

      These are Rc magnitudes that were computed from observations in other bands.

      Observation on Sep 04 1997 was removed because it didn't have an OT mag, just a mag for the OT and extended source.

      Observation on Apr 05.76 1997 has an unrealistic infinite uncertainty, so we removed it.

      BUT = Bologna University Telescope
