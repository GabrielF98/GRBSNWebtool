OT: optical transient; GAL: host galaxy; RAO: Rome Astrophysical Observatory; BUT: Bologna University Telescope; WHT: William Herschel Telescope; APO: Apache Point Observatory; NOT: Nordic Optical Telescope; INT: Isaac Newton Telescope; CA: Calar Alto 3.5 m telescope; HST: Hubble Space Telescope; P5m: Palomar 200 inch; VLT-UT1: Very Large Telescope Unit 1. 
A log of all the photometry on GRB 970228, obtained in the B, V, RC, and IC passbands (corresponding to the Johnson B and Cousins VRI systems); some photometry derived from unfiltered passbands and translated to B or RC; the HST WFPC2 and STIS filters; and the near-infrared J, H, K, and K&arcmin; passbands. In order to minimize calibration differences as a result of use of different filters/instruments and differences in analysis, we consistently determined the magnitude of the optical transient (OT) relative to our calibration.
