      Notes: Summary of VLBA Observations of GRB 991208: the Date, the Time Passed Since the Event Δt, and the Fluxes at 8.35 and 4.85 GHz. The final data point has a mistake in the date it should read 2000-Jan not 1999-Jan.

      Notes: his result uses all of our data, including a negative outlier. Alternatively, we could quote a "best'' result of  $3.3 \pm 1.2$ mJy around the time of the peak magnification in the lensing scenario. See the text for details.
