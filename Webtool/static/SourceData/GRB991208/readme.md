# GRB991208


The text files listed below were downloaded from papers on [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu) and converted to the GRBSN [format](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/tree/master/Webtool/static/SourceData). The 'Master.txt' file(s) are a combination of these text files and contain all of the downloaded data for a paticular wavelength range.

### GRB991208_Optical_IR_1.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000BASI...28...15S/abstract

**Data-type:** Opticla,Early

**Notes:**

Notes: Photometric observations of the GRB 991208. Total errors in magnitude measurements are mostly ≥0.1 while statistical errors are always ≤0.1.

### GRB991208_Radio_1.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...585..899G/abstract

**Data-type:** Radio, Late

**Notes:**

Notes: Summary of VLA Observations of GRB 991208. Removed mid times and start end times as delta t was included

### GRB991208_Radio_2.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...585..899G/abstract

**Data-type:** Radio, Late, Early

**Notes:**

Notes: Summary of VLBA Observations of GRB 991208: the Date, the Time Passed Since the Event Δt, and the Fluxes at 8.35 and 4.85 GHz

### GRB991208_Radio_3.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001A%26A...380...81S/abstract

**Data-type:** Radio, Early

**Notes:**

Notes: his result uses all of our data, including a negative outlier. Alternatively, we could quote a "best'' result of $3.3 \pm 1.2$ mJy around the time of the peak magnification in the lensing scenario. See the text for details.

### GRB991208_Radio_4.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...541L..45G/abstract

**Data-type:** Radio, Early

**Notes:**

Notes: Abbreviations: MAMBO is the Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer; OVRO MA is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array; PdBI is the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer; OVRO 40 m is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope; Ryle is the Ryle Telescope; VLA is the Very Large Array; and τatm is the sky opacity toward the source.
