    notes: |
      Notes: Magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic absorption. P60 (Cenko et al. 2009) and LBT (Dai et al. 2008) magnitudes are not reported in this table, but they are plotted in Fig. 9. KAIT-I magnitudes have been calibrated against SDSS-i′ catalogued magnitudes. Flux densities (Fν) have been estimated from extinction-corrected magnitudes.
      The other files have been removed for this GRB as they were only containing average fluxes for different bands and have no useful information regarding the data.
