**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...577A..44O/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, NIR, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes:  The GRB trigger time is t0 = 55 162.976 MJD. Data not corrected for negligible AV,host< 0.03 mag (LMC). Image subtraction of the host was performed for g′r′i′z′.

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...535A.127V/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes:  Magnitudes are corrected for Galactic extinction of E(B − V) = 0.038 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998). B, V, R, I, J, H, K are Vega magnitudes, whereas g, r, i and z are AB magnitudes.

**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...718L.150C/abstract

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical, UV

**Notes:**

Notes:  Observer-frame days after burst trigger at 2009 November 27, 23:25:45. Vega magnitudes corrected for Galactic extinction (EB−V = 0.038). In addition to the errors quoted, there is a systematic uncertainty of 0.05 mag in the SMARTS/Gemini photometric zero point.
