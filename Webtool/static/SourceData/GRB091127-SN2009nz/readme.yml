      Notes:  Magnitudes are corrected for Galactic extinction of E(B − V) = 0.038 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998). B, V, R, I, J, H, K are Vega magnitudes, whereas g, r, i and z are AB magnitudes.

      Notes:  Observer-frame days after burst trigger at 2009 November 27, 23:25:45. Vega magnitudes corrected for Galactic extinction (EB−V = 0.038). In addition to the errors quoted, there is a systematic uncertainty of 0.05 mag in the SMARTS/Gemini photometric zero point.
