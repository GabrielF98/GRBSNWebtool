The text files listed below were downloaded from papers on [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu) and converted to the GRBSN [format](https://github.com/GabrielF98/GRBSNWebtool/tree/master/Webtool/static/SourceData). The 'Master.txt' file(s) are a combination of these files containg all of the downloaded data for a paticular wavelength range.

### GRB020903_Optical2.txt

**Data-type:** Early, Late, Optical

**Notes:**

Notes: Notes.—The data in this table supersede the data presented by Fruchter et al. (2002), Gorosabel et al. (2002), and Levan et al. (2002). This is the photometry of the OT only, after subtraction of the host galaxy.



instrument column: The key to telescope identification is as follows: CTIO 4 m: Cerro Tololo 4 m; DK 1.5 m: 1.5 m Danish telescope at La Silla; TNG: 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo at La Palma; Asiago: 1.8 m telescope at Mount Ekar; Palomar 5 m: Mount Palomar 5 m Hale telescope.



2002-Oct-11.7: Average of two measurements on October 11 and October 12.

2002-Sep-10.30 & 2002-Sep-4.32: From Soderberg et al. (2004), after subtraction of the contribution from the host galaxy (see text for details). Note that these data have been reexamined by Soderberg et al. (2005), in which they use image subtraction. According to their Fig. 2, the measurement at ∼6.9 days is ∼21.8 mag, the value that we use here.



### GRB020903_Optical3.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...643..284B/abstract

**Data-type:** Late, Optical

**Notes:**

F606W: These magnitudes have been corrected for oversubtraction (see text).

R-band magnitudes: From F606W, assuming that the SED is a power law (Fν ∝ νβ) with index β = -4. The uncertainties in these magnitudes are the same as for the F606W measurements.



### GRB020903_Optical4.txt


**Source:** https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...627..877S/abstract

**Data-type:** Late, Optical

**Notes:**

HST magnitudes: From residual image. Observed magnitude, not corrected for foreground extinction.

extinction column: Galactic extinction from Schlegel et al. (1998).

R: From residual image. Corrected for foreground extinction using Aλ given in the seventh column.
