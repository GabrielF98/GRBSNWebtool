# Webtool Data Download

This page contains information regarding the status of the data downlinked for all the GRB-SNe in the webtool. 

### Status Tags - what data have we downlinked.

**`Not started`** Pretty self-explanatory, we haven’t begun to look for data yet. 

`**In progress`**  I am working on gathering data from the ADS and the full set of data on the ADS has not been downloaded. 

**`Mostly completed`** 3/4 of the main categories we want have been found and downloaded and we have looked at all papers in the ADS.

`**Completed`** The holy grail that won't happen for most of these because people made it hard to find the data or didn’t bother getting it. 

`**ADS exhausted`** I have gathered data from all the references which appear in the ADS when you search obj:GRB XXXXXX, abs:"XXXXXX" with only refereed papers used.

`**No Downloadables`** We haven’t been able to find any refereed papers with downloadable data in the ADS.

**`No ADS data`** We haven’t been able to find any refereed papers with data in the ADS.

`**New Event`** This is a young discovery so there may not be much on the ADS yet.

### State tags - what is the state of the data processing.

`**Unprocessed**` means that we haven’t processed the data to turn it all into text files.

`**Processed`** means that all data has been processed to text files for all of the files.

`*` This is a modifier for Processed that tells us there is some data we weren’t able to convert yet.

`**latex**` There are latex files that we can convert to text files but haven’t done so yet.

`**htmls`** There are html files that we can convert to text but haven’t done so yet.

### Early and Late tags - tell us what time the data was taken.

`**Early`** Data contains observations taken within 15 days of the GRB trigger time or the first observation of the SN. 

`**Late`** Data contains observations taken 15 days after the GRB trigger time or the first observation of the SN.
