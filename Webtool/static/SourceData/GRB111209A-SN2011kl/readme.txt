---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Photometric observations of GRB 111209A obtained at Gemini-N, Gemini-S, and the Very Large Telescope. The magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction; to do so would require corrections based on Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) of A_u = 0.08, A_g = 0.06, A_r = 0.04, A_i = 0.03, A_z = 0.02, A_J = 0.0013, A_H = 0.008, and A_K = 0.005.
The exposure times were given as the time multipled by the number of exposures where multiple exposures were used to find the one magnitude. The total exposure time was ca;culated by multiplying the number of exposures by the time of the exposures.

---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: The Δt time gives the mid-time of the observation relative to the Swift trigger time, and TVIS and TNIR are the exposure times in the g′r′I′z and JHKs filters, respectively. All magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic foreground extinction. Conversion to Vega magnitudes: g′AB − g′Vega = −0.062 mag, r′AB − r′Vega = 0.178 mag, i′AB − i′Vega = 0.410 mag, i′AB − i′Vega = 0.543 mag, JAB − JVega = 0.929 mag, HAB − HVega = 1.394 mag, KS,AB − KS,Vega = 1.859 mag. Corrections for Galactic extinction are  = 0.066 mag,  = 0.046 mag,  = 0.034 mag,  = 0.025 mag,  = 0.015 mag,  = 0.010 mag,  = 0.006 mag.

Notes:  Flux and apparent magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction. Given the start time and end time in minutes. Start time was used for the time and minutes were converted to seconds.

Notes: A log of the HST observations of each of GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A, showing instrument and filters used for each observation, along with the time since burst trigger and, where appropriate, the measured magnitude of the optical/IR counterpart. Removed GRB101225A data and date leaving the mjd.

---------------------------------------------------------
Notes: UVOT observations of GRB 111209A, taken in each of the UVOT filters. We have attempted to maintain separate magnitude measurements in each snapshot, where possible, in order to preserve the time series, but note that this occasionally leads to large (>0.3 mag) errors on the associated measurements.

Notes: The delta t time gives the mid-time of the observation relative to the Swift trigger time, and all magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic foreground extinction. Conversion to Vega magnitudes: uAB-uVega=1.02 mag (as given at
http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/analysis/uvot_digest/zeropts.html). The correction for Galactic extinction, using E(B-V)=0.017 mag and the Galactic extinction curve is Au=0.085 mag.
