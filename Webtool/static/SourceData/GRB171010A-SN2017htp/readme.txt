Summary of VLA Observations of GRB 171010A. 
Errors are statistical and calibration (3 per cent for C and X band, 5 per cent for K band) combined in quadrature. 
ΔT is the number of days between T0 and the observation mid-point.
The detection at 28.57 days was marginal, so we assign it a conservative 20 per cent error
VLA was operating in the B configuration.

Summary of AMI-LA Observations of GRB 171010A. Errors are statistical and calibration (5 per cent) combined in quadrature. 
ΔT is the number of days between T0 and the observation mid-point. 
The upper limit at ΔT=86.03d is three times the rms noise in the image. 
All observations were taken at a central frequency of 15.5GHz.
The observations at 8.33, 13.27 and 60.66 days: The source in these observations was not well fit by the clean beam due to residual noise.
Thus the peak flux density was used. 

The observations at 27.8, 30.66, 33.42 and 60.66 days: These observations combined data from multiple days in order to lower the noise level. 
In this case the time is the centroid of all observations used.
